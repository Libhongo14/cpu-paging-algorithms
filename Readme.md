# CPU page replacement algorithms

This repo contains the implementation of the First in first out(FIFO), Least Recently Used (LRU) and the Optimal algorithms.
Guide to running paging.py

To run the code you use python paging.py [frame size]
To change the number of pages go in the main method and change num_pages since it is a fixed variable
- This will change the number of pages that are randomly generated by the page_generator method
- You can also hard code the reference string into the pages variable if you wish to not randomise them
