Guide to running paging.py

To run the code you use python paging.py [frame size]
To change the number of pages go in the main method and change num_pages since it is a fixed variable
- This will change the number of pages that are randomly generated by the page_generator method
- You can also hard code the reference string into the pages variable if you wish to not randomise them
